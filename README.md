This is the second attempt for developing a game engine.

Main parameters:

- There is no NPM package. All of the functions have to be written by hand.
- The code language is vanilla Javascript, of course supported with minimal HTML and CSS.
- The suppoerted broswer is the current version of Chrome.
- The engine itself is a very simple 2D game engine with canvas technology. WebGL is not implemented.

Hppy coding!
